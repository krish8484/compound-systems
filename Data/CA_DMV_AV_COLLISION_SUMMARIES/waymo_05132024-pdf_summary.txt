On May 13, 2024 at 12:58 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ("Waymo AV") operating in Los Angeles, CA was in a collision involving a passenger car on eastbound Interstate 10 between Exit 2 and Exit 3A. The Waymo AV was traveling with a test driver present behind a box truck in the number 3 lane of eastbound Interstate 10 near the Bundy Drive overpass when a passenger car traveling at a high rate of speed approached the Waymo AV from behind. The passenger car partially entered the number 2 lane as the front right corner of the passenger car made contact with the rear left corner of the Waymo AV. The passenger car then made contact with the center median and came to a stop. The Waymo AV was transitioned into manual mode, and the test driver stopped the Waymo AV to the right-hand shoulder. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driverâ€™s seating position). Both vehicles sustained damage.
