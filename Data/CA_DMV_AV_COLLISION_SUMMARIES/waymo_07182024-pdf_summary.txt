On July 18, 2024 at 5:41 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving an SUV on Bush Street at Market Street. The Waymo AV was stopped facing a green traffic light on southeastbound Bush Street at the intersection with Market Street to yield to a traffic control officer who was directing traffic in the crosswalk. While the Waymo AV remained stopped and the traffic light turned yellow, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV approached the Waymo AV and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. When the traffic light ahead of the Waymo AV turned green and the Waymo AV remained stopped, the SUV reversed briefly and then changed lanes into the left adjacent lane to maneuver around the Waymo AV, making contact with the rear driver side corner of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impacts, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage, and the SUV left the scene. Print Clear Form OL 316 (REV. 7/2020) WWW
