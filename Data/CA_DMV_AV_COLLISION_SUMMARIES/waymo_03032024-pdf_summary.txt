On March 3, 2024 at 3:12 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ("Waymo AV") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a pick-up truck near the 2300 block of Cesar Chavez Street. The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on Cesar Chavez Street towards 26th Street when it approached a pick-up truck which was oriented with its rear partially in the roadway on the north side of Cesar Chavez street. The pick-up truck was stationary but its reverse lights were illuminated. The Waymo AV came to a stop momentarily to yield to the pick-up truck, then began moving again to pass the pick-up truck, which had remained stopped. After the Waymo AV started moving, the pick-up truck began reversing further out of the driveway and the rear of the pick-up truck made contact with the right side of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driverâ€™s seating position). Both vehicles sustained damage.
