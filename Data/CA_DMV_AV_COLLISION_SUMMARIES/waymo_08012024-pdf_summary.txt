On August 1, 2024 at 10:05 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in Los Angeles, California was in a collision involving an SUV on W. Jefferson Boulevard near La Brea Avenue. The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic in the leftmost lane of a two-lane section of westbound W. Jefferson Boulevard, just before the road widened to include a dedicated left turn lane in lane three. While the Waymo AV remained stopped, an SUV approached the Waymo AV from behind and partially entered the oncoming lanes of W. Jefferson Boulevard to maneuver around the Waymo AV and proceed into the dedicated left turn lane. As the SUV was passing the stopped Waymo AV, the passenger side of the SUV made contact with the rear driver side corner of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage and the SUV left the scene. Print Clear Form OL 316 (REV. 7/2020) WWW
