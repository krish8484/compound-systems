On May 8, 2024 at 11:16 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a wild animal (raccoon) on Interstate 280 Junipero Serra Freeway between exits 49B and 51. The Waymo AV was traveling eastbound on Interstate 280 in autonomous mode when a raccoon ran into the roadway from the left side of the highway in front of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV test driver transitioned to manual mode shortly before the front driver’s side of the Waymo AV made contact with the raccoon. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage.
