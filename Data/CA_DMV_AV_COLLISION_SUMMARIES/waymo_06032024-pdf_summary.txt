On June 3, 2024 at 4:54 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in Marina Del Rey, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on Admiralty Way at Bali Way. The Waymo AV was making a left turn from the rightmost dedicated left turn lane on Admiralty Way into lane two of three lanes in the eastbound direction of Bali Way. A passenger car was also making a left turn from the leftmost dedicated left turn lane (leftmost lane). The passenger car had made the turn onto Bali Way and was partially in the number 1 lane (leftmost) and partially in the number 2 lane (middle) when the front passenger side of the passenger car made contact with the rear driver side of the Waymo AV, which was traveling in the number 2 lane (middle). At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles sustained damage.
