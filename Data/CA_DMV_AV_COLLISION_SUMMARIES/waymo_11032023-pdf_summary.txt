On November 3, 2023 at 3:44 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ("Waymo AV") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on 3rd Street at Stevenson Street. The Waymo AV was stopped in the rightmost non-HOV lane on northbound 3rd Street waiting for the intersection at Stevenson Street to clear during a green light. The passenger car behind the Waymo AV was rear-ended by a pickup truck, causing the front of the passenger car to make contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). All three vehicles sustained damage.
