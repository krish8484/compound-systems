On May 15, 2024, the front right bumper of a Pony.ai autonomous vehicle (AV) scraped against a flexible plastic traffic pylon on Auto Mall Pkwy near the intersection of Auto Mall Pkwy & Grimmer Blvd, in Fremont, CA. The vehicle was operating in supervised autonomous (“Drivered”) mode. There were no other vehicles, pedestrians, or road users involved. Following the incident, the safety operator pulled over in a safe location and confirmed there was only minor cosmetic damage to the front bumper of the AV. The safety operator then promptly drove the vehicle, in manual mode, to Pony.ai’s Fremont office. There were no injuries, and the police were not called. Print Clear Form OL 316 (REV. 7/2020) WWW
