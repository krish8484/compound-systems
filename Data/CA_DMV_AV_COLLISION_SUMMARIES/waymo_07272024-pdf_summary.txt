On July 27, 2024 at 4:28 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on Cesar Chavez Street at the Bayshore Boulevard Exit. The Waymo AV was traveling east on Cesar Chavez Street when it took the one-way onramp exit to Bayshore Boulevard. As the Waymo AV was traveling through the onramp, a passenger car approached in the oncoming direction, traveling the wrong way on the one-way ramp. The Waymo AV slowed to a stop as it yielded to the oncoming passenger car. While the Waymo AV remained stopped, the passenger car passed the Waymo AV on the right of the Waymo AV. As the passenger car was passing the stopped Waymo AV, the passenger side of the passenger car made contact with the rear passenger side of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage and the passenger car left the scene. Print Clear Form OL 316 (REV. 7/2020) WWW
